## Safety Procedures
### Areas of Safety
- Personal Safety: Prevents injuries to technicians.
- Component Safety: Protects computer components from damage.
- Electrical Safety: Prevents electrocution and protects equipment from power issues.
- Chemical Safety: Ensures safe handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
### Personal Safety
#### Trip Hazards
- Cables across walkways create tripping dangers.  
- Route cables through drop ceilings, under raised floors, or use 
cable runways.
- Keep equipment out of pathways and clean up work areas.
#### Proper Lifting Techniques
- Lift with legs, not the back, by bending knees.
- Use a push cart or seek assistance for heavy or bulky items over 
40-50 pounds.
#### Protective Gear
- Use safety goggles, gloves, and masks when handling thermal 
paste, compressed air, or other hazardous tasks.
### Component Safety
#### Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
- Damage caused by the transfer of electrons from a statically 
charged body to an uncharged component.
- Use antistatic bags for component storage.
- Use ESD wrist straps and mats to safely discharge static electricity.
### Electrical Safety
- Unplug equipment before working inside the case.
- Ensure proper grounding of equipment.
- Use surge protectors to guard against voltage spikes.
### Chemical Safety
- Hazardous materials include lithium batteries, toner, lead, mercury, and 
arsenic   
- Reference Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for details on   
-- Ingredients   
-- Health risks   
-- Precautions   
-- First aid measures   
- Use protective gear when handling hazardous materials
