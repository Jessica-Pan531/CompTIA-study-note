# 2️⃣ Cable Types
## Cable Types
## Exterior of a PC: A Demonstration
## USB Cables
### USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- Widely used interface standard that connects various devices, providing both data transfer and power delivery capabilities while supporting multiple devices via daisy-chaining.
### Serial Connections (Predecessor to USB)
- Serial cables used DB9 and DB25 connectors with a D-shaped design and thumbscrews for secure attachment.
- These cables transmitted data at a slow speed of up to 115 Kbps by sending one bit at a time.
- Serial connections were limited to one device per port and were primarily used for older mice, keyboards, and external modems.
- Today, serial cables are rarely used but can still be found in legacy applications such as connecting to routers and switches.
### Advantages of USB Over Serial Connections
- USB allows up to 127 devices to be connected to a single port through daisy-chaining, compared to the one-device limit of serial cables.
- Modern USB versions offer much faster data transfer speeds compared to serial connections.
- USB provides power delivery, enabling devices to be powered directly through the cable.
### USB Versions and Data Transfer Speeds
- USB 1.0: Operates at 1.5 Mbps and was an improvement over serial connections.
- USB 1.1: Known as Full-Speed USB, increased speeds to 12 Mbps.
- USB 2.0: Known as High-Speed USB, supports up to 480 Mbps.
- USB 3.0: Referred to as SuperSpeed USB, offers speeds of up to 5 Gbps.
- USB 3.1 Gen 2: Called SuperSpeed+ USB, reaches speeds of 10 Gbps.
- USB 3.2 Gen 2x2: Provides up to 20 Gbps.
- USB 4.0: The fastest version, capable of speeds up to 40 Gbps.
### USB Distance Limitations
- USB 1.0 had a cable length limit of 3 meters (9 feet).
- USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 increased the maximum cable length to 5 meters (15 
feet).
- USB 3.0 and later versions reduced the limit back to 3 meters (9 feet) to maintain high-speed performance.
- Using longer cables can result in signal deterioration and reduced speeds.
- Some manufacturers offer cables exceeding recommended lengths, but they may compromise performance and device compatibility.
### USB Power Delivery
- USB 1.0 and USB 2.0 ports provide a maximum power output of 500 mA (0.5A).
- USB 3.0 ports deliver up to 900 mA (0.9A), which equates to 4.5 watts of power. 
- Dedicated powered USB ports, labeled as PD (Power Delivery), can provide up to 1.5A (7.5 watts).
- Charging devices via a USB port on a computer is slower compared to using a dedicated wall charger.
- Higher USB versions offer better power delivery capabilities, enabling faster charging and powering more energy-intensive devices.
### USB Connectivity Considerations
- Bandwidth is shared across all devices connected to a single USB port, meaning more connected devices can reduce the available speed for each one. 
- Practical limitations may prevent reaching the theoretical maximum of 127 devices per port due to power and performance constraints.
- Using powered USB hubs can help maintain performance by supplying additional power to connected devices.
### Best Practices for USB Usage
- Always check the USB version to match device requirements for optimal performance. 
- Use shorter cables to ensure maximum speed and signal integrity.
- Consider using powered hubs for multiple high-power devices.
- Prefer wall outlets for charging devices instead of relying on USB ports for faster charging.
### Summary
- USB cables provide a significant improvement over older serial connections by enabling higher speeds, multi-device support, and power delivery. 
- Different USB versions offer varying speeds and power capabilities, with USB 4.0 being the fastest and most powerful.
- The length of the USB cable affects its performance, and power delivery capabilities depend on the USB version and port type.
- Understanding these factors helps optimize the use of USB connections in daily applications.
## USB Connector Types
### USB Type A 
- Flat rectangular connector used in USB 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, and above.
- Connects only in one direction due to a blocking piece inside the port.   
- Commonly found on desktops and laptops.
### USB Type B
#### Used for larger devices like printers   
#### Includes three variations
- Type B Connector: Square with rounded corners on top.
- Type B Mini Connector: Trapezoid shape; found on early tablets and smartphones.
- Type B Micro Connector: Shorter, skinnier version; used for wearables, smart glasses, and small music players.
#### USB 3 Type B connectors have a square shape with an additional rectangular section on top, unlike USB 2 Type B connectors   
#### USB 3 Type B micro connectors resemble a figure eight, differing from the trapezoid-like USB 2 Type B micro connectors 
### USB Type C
- Small oval-shaped connector   
- Compatible with USB 3 and USB 4   
- Reversible design allows insertion in either direction   
- Commonly used in modern laptops, tablets, and smartphones
### Compatibility Notes
- USB 2 and USB 3 connectors of the same type (e.g., Type B or Type B Micro) are not interchangeable.   
- Always use the correct USB type for proper functionality.
