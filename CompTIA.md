# 💾 Hardware (section 2 - section 7)
## 1️⃣ Personal Computer
### Main functions
- Input
- Processing
- Storage
- Output
### Categories of Computers 
- Workstations: Desktop computers/PCs.
- Servers: Host services like file sharing or websites.(Usually in the server room or a data center.)
- Laptops: Portable versions of workstations which can run desktop operating system.
- Tablets: Highly portable devices that feature a touchscreen as the primary interface.
- Smartphones: Smaller versions of tablets that also function as a phone.
- Smart devices: Incude items like smart speakers or displays which perfom specific functions. (Usually use vocal recognition.)
- Internet of Things (IoT) Devices: Devices that connect to a network but don't fit neatly into other categories.
### Main components
⬇️⬇️⬇️
#### Hardware: All the physical parts of a computer.
- Input devices: mice and keyboards.
- Processing unit or graphic processing unit: CPU or GPU.
- Storage devices: RAM or memory
- Hard drives, solid devices and out put devices: monitors, speakers and printers.
#### Software: All the programs and operating systems that instruct hardware on what to do.
- Operating systems: Windows, Mac or Linux.
- Application software: Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.
- Drivers: The things that help the operating systems communicatewith the underlying hardware od a computer system.
#### Firmware: Software embedded in hardware component.
- Often referred to as software on a chip which can be updated through a process known as flashing.

## Safety Procedures
### Areas of Safety
- Personal Safety: Prevents injuries to technicians.
- Component Safety: Protects computer components from damage.
- Electrical Safety: Prevents electrocution and protects equipment from power issues.
- Chemical Safety: Ensures safe handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
### Personal Safety
#### Trip Hazards
- Cables across walkways create tripping dangers.  
- Route cables through drop ceilings, under raised floors, or use 
cable runways.
- Keep equipment out of pathways and clean up work areas.
#### Proper Lifting Techniques
- Lift with legs, not the back, by bending knees.
- Use a push cart or seek assistance for heavy or bulky items over 
40-50 pounds.
#### Protective Gear
- Use safety goggles, gloves, and masks when handling thermal 
paste, compressed air, or other hazardous tasks.
### Component Safety
#### Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
- Damage caused by the transfer of electrons from a statically 
charged body to an uncharged component.
- Use antistatic bags for component storage.
- Use ESD wrist straps and mats to safely discharge static electricity.
### Electrical Safety
- Unplug equipment before working inside the case.
- Ensure proper grounding of equipment.
- Use surge protectors to guard against voltage spikes.
### Chemical Safety
- Hazardous materials include lithium batteries, toner, lead, mercury, and 
arsenic   
- Reference Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for details on   
-- Ingredients   
-- Health risks   
-- Precautions   
-- First aid measures   
- Use protective gear when handling hazardous materials
## Troubleshooting Methodology
### Purpose of Troubleshooting
- Identify the root cause of issues or find workarounds to restore 
functionality.
- Follow a systematic and repeatable process to allow other technicians to understand the steps taken and continue troubleshooting.
### CompTIA Six-Step Troubleshooting Methodology
- Step 1: Identify the Problem.
-- Gather information from the user   
-- Identify user changes   
-- Perform backups before making changes   
-- Determine environmental or infrastructure changes 
- Step 2: Establish a Theory of Probable Cause.
-- Question the obvious
-- Research symptoms through resources like search engines or AI chatbots.
- Step 3: Test the Theory to Determine the Cause.
-- Confirm or disprove the theory by testing.  
-- Reestablish a theory or escalate the issue if the theory is not confirmed.
- Step 4: Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Implement the Solution.
-- Create a plan to address the identified issue.   
-- Follow manufacturer or vendor instructions when applicable.
- Step 5: Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventative Measures.
-- Test the system to ensure the issue is resolved.
-- Apply preventative measures to avoid future occurrences.
- Step 6: Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes.
-- Record the problem, solution, and results in the appropriate system.
### Examples for Key Steps
- Step 1: If a system won’t power on, gather details from the user and check for environmental changes like power outages.
- Step 2: For a computer that doesn’t power on, check if it is plugged in or if the outlet has power.
- Step 3: Test the outlet by plugging in another device.
- Step 5: Verify the system is functional and implement measures like issuing covered cups to employees to prevent spills.
